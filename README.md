# Model Training

```
python train.py
```

# Motivation
Existing methods often fall short in capturing the comprehensive multi-granularity spatial-temporal correlations due to three primary limitations: (1) usersâ€™ complex mobility patterns entangled in multi-granularity spatial-temporal data, (2) limited mobility patterns details due to independent modeling at each granularity, and (3) low inference efficiency in cascaded multi-granularity predictions.

# Cross-Granularity Visualization
We visualized the context similarity weight matrix of the trajectory sequence for user ID 2064 to provide further evidence that learning factual cross-granularity relationships improves prediction results. We observed that fine-grained attention shares a similar attention distribution with coarser-grained attention, verifying that fine-grained movement patterns rely on coarse-grained ones.
